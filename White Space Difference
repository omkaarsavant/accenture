White Space Difference
You are given 2 strings A and B. Your task is to find and return a string saying Even if the value representing the absolute differences between the number of
whitespaces in both the strings is divisible by 2 else Odd if the value representing the absolute differences between the number of whitespaces in both the strings the whitespace is not divisible by 2 along with the difference value
Input Specification:
input1: A string A
input2: A string B

Output Specification:
Return a string saying 'Even if the value representing the absolute differences between the number of whitespaces in both the strings is divisible by 2 else "Odd' if the value representing the absolute differences between the number of whitespaces in both the strings the whitespace is not divisible by 2
