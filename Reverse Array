Reverse Array

lan has been given an array A of length N and he wants to find the sum of even positions after reversing the array. Your task is to help him find and return an integer value representing sum of the array elements present at the even positions of the reversed array.
Input Specification:
input1: A reversed integer array A
input2: An integer N, representing length of the array.
Output Specification:
Return an integer value representing sum of the array elements present at the even positions of the array.
Example 1:
input1: (10,20,30,40,50,60) 
input2: 6
Output: 120
60,50,40,30,20,10
even pos: 60,40,20
so sum= 120

-->
#include <iostream>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int A[]={21,24,67,13,24,27};
    int n=sizeof(A)/sizeof(A[0]);
    int sum;
    
    for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i-=2)
    {
        sum+=A[i];
    }
    cout<<sum;
    return 0;
}
