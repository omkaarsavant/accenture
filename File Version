File Version

You are given a string array S that contains the names of some files along with their versions. Your task is to find and return an integer
value representing the latest version out of all the files that are correctly named in the array. A file is considered correct if it follows the format of the file named as "File_X" (where X represents the file version number). Return -1 if there are no correct files in the array.
Note:
• A file is incorrect if the name of the file does not match the format.
• If there is no file in the files array then also return -1.
Input Specification:
input1: A string array S, representing the names of the files. 
input2: An integer value representing the size of the array.

Example 1:
input1: (File 1,File 3,File 2) 
input2:3
Output:3
Explanation 
Here the given file is ("File_1", "File_3","File 2"). As we can see, all the files are named using the correct file format of "File Version". The second file has the greatest file version, which is 3, so 3 is returned a
as the output.

Example 2:
input1:{}
input2:0
Output:-1
Explanation:
Here the given file array is {}. As we can see, there are no files in the array. Hence -1 is returned as the output.
