You are given 3 integers A, B and N. Your task is to make either of A or B strictly greater than N. You can perform any of the following operations any number of times. Increment A by B.
 Increment B by A.
Your task is to find and print the minimum number of operations required to make either of A or B strictly greater than N.
Input Format:
The input consists of a single line:
The line contains three space-separated integers A, B and N.
The input will be read from the STDIN by the candidate
Output Format:
Print the number that represents minimum number of operation required to make either of A or B strictly greater than N. The output will be matched to the candidate's output printed on the STDOUT
Constraints:
 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^9 
1 ≤ B≤ 10^9 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9 
A≤N 
B≤N 
Input:
1 2 3 
Output:
2
Explanation:
You can increment A by B twice to make it strictly greater than N.
