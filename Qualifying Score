There is a competition in a school. A qualifying score of 35 marks or more has been set as the cut-off to take part in this competition.
There are N subjects taught in a class. The marks obtained in each subject in semesters 1 and 2 are given in the form of two arrays S1 and S2 respectively. The qualifying score is calculated in the following way.

Step 1: Subtract the marks obtained in the ith subject in Semester 1 from the marks obtained in the i subject in Semester 2, ie, S2[i]-S1[i], where = 0, 1,2,....
Step 2: Add the marks of upto P subjects with the maximum scores obtained after the subtraction in Step 1. This will give a student's qualifying score. The aim is to get a score equal to or greater than 35.
If the qualifying score is greater than or equal to 35 then the student qualifies to participate in the competition, else they are disqualified. Your task is to find and return a string value, representing the result 'Qualified' or 'Disqualified' followed by the score achieved (separated by a space).

Input Specification:
input1: An integer value N, representing the number of subjects taught in a class.
input2: An integer value P. representing the maximum number of subjects that can be considered to calculate the qualifying score.
input3: An integer array S1, representing the marks obtained in the N subjects in Semester 1.
input4: An integer array S2, representing the marks obtained in the N subjects in Semester 2

Test Case 1
Input:

N = 3
P = 2
S1 = [10, 20, 30]
S2 = [40, 50, 60]
Explanation:

Calculate the difference array: [30, 30, 30]
Take the top P = 2 scores: [30, 30]
Sum of top scores: 30 + 30 = 60
Output: "Qualified 60"

Test Case 2
Input:

N = 5
P = 3
S1 = [15, 25, 35, 20, 30]
S2 = [35, 30, 40, 25, 40]
Explanation:

Difference array: [20, 5, 5, 5, 10]
Top P = 3 scores: [20, 10, 5]
Sum: 20 + 10 + 5 = 35
Output: "Qualified 35"
