Clock Problem
Your friend has problem in reading the time if a clock follows 24-hour format, so you to help him out. You have two integers X and Y. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the product of these two integers in the 12- hour system.
Input Specification:
input1: An integer value X 
input2: An integer value Y

Output Specification:
Return an integer value representing the product of the two integers in the 12-hour system.

Example 1: 
input1:4 
input2:5
Output: 8

-->
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> 
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 123, y = 456; // Example inputs
    int t = x * y;

    // Handle zero product
    if (t == 0) {
        cout << 12; // 0 in 12-hour clock is treated as 12
    } else {
        // Map the absolute value of the product to the 12-hour clock
        int result = abs(t) % 12;

        // If remainder is 0, map it to 12 (since 0 maps to 12 in 12-hour format)
        if (result == 0) {
            result = 12;
        }

        cout << result;
    }

    return 0;
}
