Printing Job
There is a printing shop where the customers submit their print jobs at regular intervals, and each job takes a fixed amount of time to complete. You are given an integer value N denoting the total number of print jobs, and X denoting the time duration after which the next print job arrives.

Your task is to find and return an integer vating how long the last job will have to wait in the queue considering one print will take exactly 10 minutes. If in case, there is no waiting time then return 0.

input1: An integer value N representing the number of printing

input2: An integer value X representing the time duration after which the next print job arrives.
Output Specification
Return an integer value representing how long the latte queue considering one pent will take exactly 10 minutes
waiting time then return 0
Input1 :4
Input2 :5
Output: 15
Explanation:
Here N=4 and X=5. Time to complete one pet job is 10 mins. So, the time
needed for three prints is 3*10=30 The last pint job arrives at 15 min (3*5)
the waiting time is 30-15=15. Hence 15 is output.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n=4;
    int t=5;
    int time_needed,arriv,wait;
    
    time_needed=(n-1)*10;
    arriv=(n-1)*t ;  
    wait=time_needed-arriv;
    
    cout<<wait;
    
    return 0;
}
